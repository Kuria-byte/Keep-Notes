# Keep-Notes
- This is a mock up of the Google Keeper.
- In the meantime there is no database attached and I'm using props and arrays to emulate a temorary storage.
- ***Keeper V4.0.0.0*** will feature a database:firestore and firebase.


## CodeSandBox✔
- If you visit CodeSandbox you'll find the keeper app ranging from ***Keeper V1.0.0.0*** to ***Keeper V3.0.0.0*** which is the current version
- I've versioned it this way to make it easy for you to progressively follow up.
